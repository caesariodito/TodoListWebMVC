# Thoughts

It's just a basic todolist web mvc application, monolith, localdb database (which available on windows only), and razor pages. I think I have a pretty solid understanding to develop bigger projects but I still lacks few of knowledge on the database relational stuff. The framework is neat if you want to develop enterprise application, like everything is available under the hood and acccessible with just one click of a button. But ig, it's a fun journey for me. Would rate for 8/10.

# What I learned

- their MVC mechanism
- data Validation is available in the model 'repository'/directory
- viewmodel logic!?!?
- linq
- search functionality is created in the index functions of the controller
- their tag helpers in razor pages file
- they have a similar structure to svelte or next modern structure (on the views directory)
- their migrations mechanism `Add-Migration [name]` and `Update-Database`

# Future improvement

- containerized the app
- try to run it on linux
- deploy it
- this is .NET Core 8, trying to look at the legacies on .NET Core 5
- implement database relations (one-to-many, etc)
- try the debugging features since I saw em a lot in the community
